# WeatherApp

## Introduction
I started this project during the bootcamp.
It's a Single Page Application which consumes the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API to display the weather information of the given city.
I thought it was a cool idea to make it feel live so I decide to show different weather icons based on clima and time of the day.

## Goal
This project was so useful to better understand at the very begining how to fetch data from a 3rd party API and use it to generate a valuable information for the user.
